# Rock-Paper-Scissor Classification : Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand gesture-based game where three possible gestures (rock, paper, and scissors) are made using hand signs. This project is the final project in Dicoding DBS Foundation Coding Camp 2024: Machine Learning Developer. This project aims to leverage computer vision and deep learning to classify hand gestures. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a model has been trained to identify the hand gestures from images accurately.
